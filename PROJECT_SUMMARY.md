## Technical Implementation

### Speech Recognition
- Uses Chrome's Web Speech API (`webkitSpeechRecognition`)
- Continuous recognition with interim results
- Handles common errors (network, permissions, no-speech)
- Auto-restart feature to work around 60-120 second limit

### Text-to-Speech
- Uses Web Speech Synthesis API
- British female voice selection (when available)
- Speech rate: 0.75 (slower for children)
- Pitch: 1.2 (feminine tone)
- Queued utterances with completion detection

### Animal Database Structure
```javascript
{
    'animal_name': {
        emoji: 'ü¶Å',
        habitat: 'savanna|forest|ocean|farm|jungle|arctic|desert|mountain',
        facts: [
            'Fact 1',
            'Fact 2',
            'Fact 3'
        ]
    }
}
```

### CSS Animations
- Bouncing title animation
- Pulsing microphone when listening
- Animal emoji movement animation
- Fade-in effects for facts
- Gradient habitat backgrounds

## Features Completed

1. ‚úÖ 50 animals with emojis and facts
2. ‚úÖ Speech recognition for animal names
3. ‚úÖ Cartoon-style CSS animations
4. ‚úÖ British female voice narration
5. ‚úÖ Auto-restart after speaking
6. ‚úÖ Child-friendly colorful design
7. ‚úÖ Interactive animal list

9. ‚úÖ GitHub Pages hosting
10. ‚úÖ Mobile responsive design

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Chrome Speech API Limitations**:
   - Requires internet connection
   - Stops after 60-120 seconds
   - May not work in some environments (Electron, etc.)

2. **Voice Selection**:
   - British female voice depends on system availability
   - Falls back to any British or default voice

3. **Animation Limitations**:
   - Currently using CSS animations with emojis
   - Could be upgraded to Lottie or Rive for better quality

## Future Enhancements

1. **Animation Upgrades**:
   - Implement Lottie animations from LottieFiles
   - Add Rive interactive animations
   - Consider 3D animations with Spline

2. **Game Features**:
   - Score tracking
   - Multiple difficulty levels
   - Animal sounds
   - Quiz mode
   - Progress tracking

3. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Offline support with local speech recognition
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) features
   - Multi-language support
   - Improved error recovery
